                    <p class="p-write">Sudais took up his imamate in 1984, at just 24-years of age, and conducted his first sermon 
                    at Masjid al-Haram in July 1984, other than this Sheikh Saud 
                    al-Shuraim - has been his partner in Taraweeh Prayers from 1994
                    till 2006, and again in 2014, 2019 and 2020. They were titled 
                    "Twins of the Haram".[16] In 2005-2020, Sheikh 
                    Abdullah Awad al-Juhany and other imams of Masjid al-Haram such as
                     heikh Yasser al-Dosari and Sheikh Bander Baleela took over 
                    al-Shuraim's position as imam of the first Rakat of the 
                    Khatm al-Quran (End of the Quran) Taraweeh prayer.
                    In 2005, al-Sudais was named by the Dubai 
                    International Holy Quran Award (DIHQA) Organising

                <p>In 2003, Sudais stated that he believes that youth need to be taught Islamic law, 
                    including the precepts of the prohibition on killing oneself and the prohibition against attacking non-Muslims living in Islamic countries. Sudais 
                    has also said that Islamic youth should not "indiscriminately hurl 
                    the label of atheism and not to confuse between legitimate jihad 
                    and…the terrorizing of peaceable people."[21]
                    Sudais has said that there is no room for extremism
                    and sectarianism in Islam and that Islam teaches a 
                    moderate path. He said the solution to problems that
                    Muslims face in Palestine, Somalia, Iraq, Kashmir,
                    Yemen and Afghanistan lies in following the teachings of Islam in letter and spirit. He called for resolution of 
                    conflicts through dialogue and negotiations taking into consideration the social and economic benefits that can be achieved 
                    by resolving these disputes.[22]
                    Sudais also criticized the Lal Masjid administration
                     during the 2007 Red Mosque crisis in Islamabad, 
                     Pakistan. He urged the militants and the government to agree to a peaceful resolution through dialogue and urged 
                     both parties to protect peace.[23]
                    Sudais is also known for his sermons calling on believers to help other Muslims in war-torn regions.[11] 
                    He has actively spoken out against the persecution of Palestinians by Israeli settlers and the state of Israel,[10] and 
                    has pleaded for medical supplies and food to be sent to the Palestinians.</p>
